## [sfpowerscripts](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/)

sfpowerscripts(v13.6.16) features the following

‚≠ê New Features
- Introducing fast feedback mode, Now run your validation checks more faster by selectively deploying only the changed components of the package and triggering only the impacted test class. Read the decision record [here](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/blob/develop/decision%20records/validate/002-fast-feedback.md). You can turn on fast feedback by adding the --fastfeedback flag in the validate command. We believe this change along with upcoming changes in 'prepare' will ensure the validation experience remains performant.

### Notice
This version of sfpowerkit continues to use better-sqlite to do caching during profile reconciliation. Due to usage of this dependency, while installing sfpowerkit, you need to have node-gyp installed on your docker image/machine. Refer to issues [#645](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerkit/issues/645) and [#646](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerkit/issues/646). We are analyzing on how we can better address this. PR's are welcome

To install **node-gyp**, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp).

ü™≤ Bug Fixes
- Fix reconcile for child metadata (e.g. Custom Fields) - [Issue #662](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerkit/issues/662)
- Fix if some tags are not available
- Fix where files with special characters were not merged properly - [Issue #583](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerkit/issues/583)

 - Introducing 'testSynchronous' , a new property which will let sfpowerscripts know that whether to execute a particular package in synchronous mode. This allows validation to be run in different modes for different packages
 - The following diagram depicts the new features in sfpowerscripts for Apex Test Validation Process![ApexTestInPackage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59901319/163011363-f081c2e2-ec6b-45ce-9662-2ab14add5290.png)

# December 21

# [sfpowerscripts](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/)

December 21 (v10.2.0) features the following features and fixes

## üí£  Breaking Changes
- For wider compatibility across build systems, we have changed execution of scripts using shell as opposed to bash. Refer to the issue raised by @gretarvp [#745](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/745). Any specific pre/post scripts using bash specific commands/features must be refactored.

- Package diff check no longer builds packages when there is a change in scratch org configuration. Users are recommended to update version numbers of the package that need to be rebuilt. [#780](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/780)

## :star: New Features
- sfpowerscripts is now able to validate dependencies in 'validate' stage, surfacing dependency issues early. This is an 'alpha' feature and we are collecting feedback across projects. Please check additional options in the validate command to enable this feature. We will be iterating on this feature in subsequent releases [#764](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/764)
- vlocity record based configuration is now supported as a data package [#633](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/633). Read more about how to use vlocity here [data-packages](https://sfpowerscripts.dxatscale.io/v/release-december-21/faq/package-types/data-packages)
