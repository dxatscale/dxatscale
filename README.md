December 21 (v10.2.0) features the following features and fixes

## üí£  Breaking Changes
- For wider compatibility across build systems, we have changed execution of scripts using shell as opposed to bash. Refer to the issue raised by @gretarvp [#745](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/745). Any specific pre/post scripts using bash specific commands/features must be refactored.
- We have deprecated npmTag across all the stages. Please utilize LATEST_GIT_TAG or LATEST_TAG in release definition files [#687](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/687)
- Package diff check no longer builds packages when there is a change in scratch org configuration. Users are recommended to update version numbers of the package that need to be rebuilt. [#780](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/780)

## :star: New Features
- sfpowerscripts is now able to validate dependencies in 'validate' stage, surfacing dependency issues early. This is an 'alpha' feature and we are collecting feedback across projects. Please check additional options in the validate command to enable this feature. We will be iterating on this feature in subsequent releases [#764](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/764)
- vlocity record based configuration is now supported as a data package [#633](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/633). Read more about how to use vlocity here [data-packages](https://sfpowerscripts.dxatscale.io/v/release-december-21/faq/package-types/data-packages)


## :beetle: Bug Fixes
- Fix an issue with workitem metrics being reported incorrectly in a release [#777](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/pull/777)
- Dry Run in release command is installing package dependencies [#774](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/774)
- Test Class parser doesn't detect classes with SOQL Queries UPDATE VIEWSTAT & UPDATE TRACKING [#724](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/724)
- validateAgainstOrg no longer utilizes diffCheck, removing any needs of workaround [#754](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/754)
