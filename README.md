## [sfpowerkit](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerkit)

sfpowerkit(v6.1.0) - January 23

## :boom: Deprecation Notice - March 2023
Added deprecation notice on commands as sfpowerkit is being discontinued in March 2023 completely. Please keep an eye on the repo for alternate suggestions and commands


# November 22

## [sfpowerscripts](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts/)

sfpowerscripts(v20.2.6) features the following

## 💣  Breaking Changes

-  **Additional new modes for validate command [#1133]** 

We heard you loud and clear, that you need flexibility with validate command depending on the type of repository and project configuration.  On some projects you would need to limit your validation boundary, only validate a changed package etc, we support it all. Read more [here](https://docs.dxatscale.io/v/release-november-22/sfpowerscripts/validate#validate-modes).

Unfortunately, that means we had to break up the command line parameters, a new flag called mode is added (defaults to thorough) to access other modes

-  **NPM Scope Names [#1168]** 

This release breaks the behaviour of how we handle scope names for NPM Package Registries. Please review and update your YAML configuration files in your pipelines if you encounter any issues authenticating to your package registry with the scope using the '@' and remove the '@' prefix as needed in your environment variables to ensure orchestrator commands execute successfully.  We are working to bring back functionality to handle this and make it uniform across platforms in the near future.

## :star: New Features

- **Create pools with a set of specified artifacts[#978]**

Utilize [release config](https://docs.dxatscale.io/v/release-november-22/sfpowerscripts/release/release-definition-generator#config-file) to limit the artifacts installed in scratch orgs and use the same in validate command. We would also like to thank @domrycz  for  contributing majority code for the feature and testing the early releases


- ****[Beta]** '~~validate' to identify~~ fix incorrect transitive dependencies [#855](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts/issues/855).** 

Add  enableTransitiveDependencyResolver:true, to the plugins section of sfdx-project.json will enable this feature. 

```
 "plugins": {
        "sfpowerscripts": {
            enableTransitiveDependencyResolver:true // enable transitive dependency resolution 
            "ignoreFiles": {
                "prepare": ".forceignore",
                "validate": ".forceignore",
                "quickbuild": "forceignores/.quickbuildignore",
                "build": "forceignores/.buildignore"
            }
        }
    }

```

- **Utilize packaging lib for all package related operations, this removes the dependency on sfdx-cli  [#1121](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts/issues/1121).**


## :star: Enhancements
- Prepare command creates too many Scratch Orgs when using snapshot pool [#1105](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts/issues/1105)  Thanks  @domrycz  for figuring out the missed scenario


## :beetle: Bug Fixes

- Issue when publishing "big" artifacts [#1149](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts/issues/1149). Thanks to @alanjaouen for raising the issue as well as PR to fix it
- Artifacts aren't pulled correctly releasedefinition:generate [#1140](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts/issues/1140) @Schuchie 
- Scratch Org Pool creation script failing "Unable to execute command .. Error: Can't find package id for dependency: 04txxxx" [#1113](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts/issues/1113)[eneag-sf] @eneag-sf
- Update core libs to fix 'org not found' issues during lengthy deployments

# September 22

## [sfpowerscripts](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts/)

sfpowerscripts(v19.7.3) features the following

## :star: New Features

-  **Support for multiple release definitions**
   
   Release command now supports multiple release definition as input. This allows a release manager to composite releases from different domains more easily and release them in a single transaction.


## :star: Enhancements

-  **Ability to skip all external package dependencies while generating a release definition** 

     When you are generating release definitions using multiple filters to composited later, external package dependencies might get repeated and it may also not be required for every files. Now release definition generator have an additional parameter 
 ```excludeAllPackageDependencies:<boolean>``` to skip package dependencies being added to  generated release defnitions.

-  **Utilize sfdx cli docker image as the base and minor docker improvements**
      
     We are switching to utilising sfdx-cli as the base docker image. This reduces the image size and provides better stability in fixating on the version of the cli

-  **Makes logs more concise and easy to read**
   
     Logs have been made much more concise to read and interpret in various commands. This will help in readability 

-  **Auto Log Grouping**

    Logs are now automatically grouped for Github Actions, Gitlab, Buildkite and Azure Pipelines even if the '-g (loggroup)' flag is not used

## :beetle: Bug Fixes

-  **Release fails if its unable to push a changelog**
-  **If 2 failing test methods have the same name, they get removed from test results (#1111)**  Thanks @Chiqqn and @domrycz  for raising the issue and fixing the same
-  **Incorrect Error Handling on Deployment Failure during validate (#1123)**

# August 22

## [sfpowerscripts](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts/)

## :star: New Features

-  **Generate Release Definition  Automatically**

Last release we announced a beta version of 'releasedefinition:generate'. While the idea was solid, the command lacked flexibility and it was put back to the drawing board. This release we have created a whole new of way interacting with the command. Read more about it in the descision record [here](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts/blob/b644a3c8de458b39f6e0a6174255b3b1d54da85f/decision%20records/release/006-release-defn-generator.md) .  Documentation is updated on how to use this command as well. Check out the link [here](https://docs.dxatscale.io/sfpowerscripts/release/release-definition-generator). Thanks to @Schuchie  for the feedback

- **Support for Distinct Scratch Org Definitions**

You might need to use this feature very rarely, but if the need arises, you have it. This feature allows a user to specify a unique scratch org config file for building a package. When the feature is enabled and the package name is matched, the build command will use specified config file for that package. Read more about it [here](https://docs.dxatscale.io/sfpowerscripts/build-and-quick-build#distinct-scratch-org-definition)

## :star: Enhancements

- **Enhanced Package Dependencies Installation**

sfpowerscripts no longer utilise the 'sfpowerkit:package:dependencies:install' to install dependencies. A new implementation is being utilised by validate/prepare/release commands. This command utilise the same dependency resolver used by package and removes lot of technical debt. 

- **Change in dependencies installation order**

validate will no longer install all the external dependencies upfront.  External dependencies will only be installed if the required package has to be validated and it will be installed just in time. This will make help with further increasing the speed of validate especially in thorough mode and change in package dependencies


- **Skip package installations if a higher version is already installed**

sfpowerscripts will now skip external dependencies such as managed package thats gets automatically upgraded in the target org.  Unfortunately this can only work after noticing a failed installation in the org and reading the error message. Read more about the discussion here (https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerkit/issues/602)

```
Installing Package Salesforce CPQ in buildbot@dxatscale.io.hotfix
A higher version of this package is already installed and can't be downgraded, skipping
```

- **Add support for multiple work item filters in changelog**

Release definition files now support  multiple work item filters, using the `workItemFilters', which expect an array of regex pattern filters. The changelog will pick up work items that match all the patterns


## :beetle: Bug Fixes

* We have fixed few internal defects as well

sfpowerscripts(v13.6.16) features the following

⭐ New Features
- Introducing fast feedback mode, Now run your validation checks more faster by selectively deploying only the changed components of the package and triggering only the impacted test class. Read the decision record [here](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/blob/develop/decision%20records/validate/002-fast-feedback.md). You can turn on fast feedback by adding the --fastfeedback flag in the validate command. We believe this change along with upcoming changes in 'prepare' will ensure the validation experience remains performant.

# December 21

# [sfpowerscripts](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/)

December 21 (v10.2.0) features the following features and fixes

## 💣  Breaking Changes
- For wider compatibility across build systems, we have changed execution of scripts using shell as opposed to bash. Refer to the issue raised by @gretarvp [#745](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/745). Any specific pre/post scripts using bash specific commands/features must be refactored.
- We have deprecated npmTag across all the stages. Please utilize LATEST_GIT_TAG or LATEST_TAG in release definition files [#687](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/687)
- Package diff check no longer builds packages when there is a change in scratch org configuration. Users are recommended to update version numbers of the package that need to be rebuilt. [#780](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/780)

## :star: New Features
- sfpowerscripts is now able to validate dependencies in 'validate' stage, surfacing dependency issues early. This is an 'alpha' feature and we are collecting feedback across projects. Please check additional options in the validate command to enable this feature. We will be iterating on this feature in subsequent releases [#764](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/764)
- vlocity record based configuration is now supported as a data package [#633](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/633). Read more about how to use vlocity here [data-packages](https://sfpowerscripts.dxatscale.io/v/release-december-21/faq/package-types/data-packages)


## :beetle: Bug Fixes
- Fix an issue with workitem metrics being reported incorrectly in a release [#777](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/pull/777)
- Dry Run in release command is installing package dependencies [#774](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/774)
- Test Class parser doesn't detect classes with SOQL Queries UPDATE VIEWSTAT & UPDATE TRACKING [#724](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/724)
- validateAgainstOrg no longer utilizes diffCheck, removing any needs of workaround [#754](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerscripts/issues/754)
